According to Article 706, if an obligor pays or delivers anything before the obligation falls due, they cannot demand the return of the payment or delivery. However, if the payment or delivery was made by mistake, the obligee must return the benefit gained as a result. Therefore, if an obligor mistakenly believes that the time of performance has arrived and tenders anything, they cannot demand the return of the thing tendered."}, {"@id": "H22-28-4", "@label": "N", "t1": "Article 707\n(1) If a person that is not an obligor has performed an obligation by mistake and the obligee, acting in good faith, has allowed the instrument to be lost, has damaged the instrument, has waived the security, or has lost the claim by prescription, the person performing the obligation may not demand the return of subject matter of the performance.\n(2) The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not preclude the person performing an obligation from exercising the right to reimbursement against the obligor.", "t2": "Performance by a third party is also effective, and thus even if the an obligation of another person has been performed by mistake, the person who made the performance cannot demand the return of the performance to the obligee.", "ChatGPT_output": "The hypothesis is true. According to Article 707 of the Japanese Civil Code, if a third party performs an obligation by mistake, and the obligee, acting in good faith, has relied on that performance and suffered some kind of detriment (such as losing the claim by prescription or damaging the instrument), the person who made the performance cannot demand the return of the performance. However, the person performing the obligation may still exercise the right to reimbursement against the obligor. Therefore, the third party cannot demand the return of the performance from the obligee, but can seek reimbursement from the obligor."}]
