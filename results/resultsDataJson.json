The legal capacity of a minor is limited because of their age, and as such, they may not be able to enter into certain types of contracts or agreements.\n\nRule 2: An agent is a person authorized to act on behalf of another person or entity in legal matters. The agent must have qualified legal capacity to perform legal acts on behalf of the principal.\n\nApplication: Based on the rules outlined above, it can be inferred that a minor may not be an agent since they lack qualified legal capacity. As a minor, they cannot enter into legally binding contracts, and therefore, they cannot act as an agent for another person.\n\nConclusion: Therefore, the hypothesis \"A minor may not be an agent\" is true based on the legal reasoning approach outlined above."}, {"@id": "H22-23-A", "@label": "N", "t1": "Article 608\n(1) If a lessee has defrayed necessary expenses with respect to the leased thing which ought to be borne by the lessor, the lessee may immediately demand the reimbursement of the same from the lessor.\n(2) If the lessee has incurred beneficial expenses with respect to the leased thing, the lessor must reimburse those expenses on termination of the lease in compliance with the provisions of Article 196, paragraph (2);provided, however, that the court may, at the lessor's request, grant a reasonable period of time for the reimbursement of the same.", "t2": "In cases where a lessee has defrayed necessary expenses with respect to the leased Thing in order to preserve the condition appropriate for profit from ordinary use of the subject, the lessee can wait for the end of the lease and demand the reimbursement of the same from the lessor.", "ChatGPT_output": "\n\nThesis: The hypothesis being considered is \"In cases where a lessee has defrayed necessary expenses with respect to the leased Thing in order to preserve the condition appropriate for profit from ordinary use of the subject, the lessee can wait for the end of the lease and demand the reimbursement of the same from the lessor.\"\n\nRule 1: Article 608(1) states that if a lessee has defrayed necessary expenses with respect to the leased thing which ought to be borne by the lessor, the lessee may immediately demand the reimbursement of the same from the lessor.
