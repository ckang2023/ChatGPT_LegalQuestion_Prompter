Article 96(2) states that if a third party commits fraud, inducing the first party to make a manifestation of intention to a second party, that manifestation of intention is voidable only if the second party knew or could have known that fact. Additionally, Article 96(3) stipulates that rescission of a manifestation of intention induced by fraud under the preceding two paragraphs may not be duly asserted against a third party in good faith acting without negligence.\n\nApplication:\nThe premise states that the manifestation of intention was induced by duress emanating from a third party. As per Article 96(1), such manifestation of intention is voidable. However, the premise also states that the rescission of such manifestation of intention can be made only if the other party knew or was negligent of such fact. This condition is not mentioned in Article 96(1) and goes beyond the scope of the rule. Furthermore, Article 96(2) mentions such a condition only in cases of fraud and not duress.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the above analysis, the hypothesis is False. A person who made a manifestation of intention which was induced by duress emanated from a third party can rescind such manifestation of intention on the basis of duress, regardless of whether the other party knew or was negligent of such fact."}, {"@id": "H19-4-I", "@label": "Y", "t1": "Article 128\nWhile it is uncertain whether or not a condition will be fulfilled, a party to a juridical act that is subject to a condition may not prejudice the other party's interests that would arise from the juridical act upon fulfillment of the condition.", "t2": "In a sales contract subject to  a condition precedent, the buyer that intentionally damaged the object while it is uncertain whether or not the condition has been fulfilled shall bear liability for damages to the seller whose expectation right is infringed.", "ChatGPT_output": "\n\nIssue: Who bears the liability for damages in a sales contract subject to a condition precedent if the buyer intentionally damages the object while it is uncertain whether or not the condition has been fulfilled?\n\nRule:\nAccording to Article 128, if a party to a juridical act subject to a condition is uncertain whether or not the condition will be fulfilled, they may not prejudice the other party's interests that would arise from the juridical act upon fulfillment of the condition.\n\nApplication:\nIn the premise, a sales contract is subject to a condition precedent, and it is uncertain whether or not the condition will be fulfilled. The buyer intentionally damages the object while it is still uncertain whether the condition has been fulfilled. As per Article 128, the buyer cannot prejudice the seller's interests that would arise from the sales contract upon fulfillment of the condition. Therefore, the buyer shall bear liability for damages to the seller whose expectation right is infringed.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the above analysis, the hypothesis is True.

Article 162(2) states that a person who possesses the property of another for 10 years peacefully and openly with the intention to own it acquires ownership thereof if the person was acting in good faith and was not negligent at the time when the possession started.\n\nApplication:\nIn the premise, a person starts possessing the property without knowledge and was not negligent of another's ownership of the property. Later, the possessor became aware of another person's ownership during possession. The hypothesis suggests that even in such cases, the period of prescription shall be calculated as a possessor in bad faith.\n\nHowever, Article 162 does not provide for a provision for such a situation. The law only differentiates between possession in good faith and possession in bad faith at the start of possession. It does not consider the situation where the possessor may have acquired knowledge of another's ownership during the possession.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the above analysis, the hypothesis is False. The law does not provide for a provision to calculate the period of prescription as a possessor in bad faith in cases where the possessor started the possession without knowledge and was not negligent of another's ownership of the property but subsequently knew about it during possession."}]
