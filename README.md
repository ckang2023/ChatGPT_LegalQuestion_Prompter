Install Python 3 on your machine (project default is Python 3.7): https://www.python.org/downloads/

Set up a integrated development environment (IDE) on your machine. Recommendation: PyCharm, VSCode

### Local Setup

In terminal, `cd` into `git` directory. 

Then, `git clone` the repository. (Using HTTP Link)

`cd` into the cloned project repository. 

**Check out a new branch for local testing** (Very important to avoid version control conflicts)

command line: `git checkout -b local_testing_branch_myname`.

You can use `git branch` to check your current branch.

Then, you need to setup a virtual environment for the project to be configured: 

`python3 -m venv /path/to/cloned_repository_on_your_machine`

Activate virtual environment: `source /path/to/venv/bin/activate`

Afterwards, install the project's dependencies with command: 

`pip install -r requirements.txt` (Note, you might need to install pip if error pops up)
