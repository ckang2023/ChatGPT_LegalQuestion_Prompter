However, this does not apply to a juridical act for merely acquiring a right or being released from an obligation. Article 5(2) further states that a juridical act in contravention of the provisions of paragraph (1) is voidable. Article 5(3) allows a minor to dispose of property if their legal representative has permitted them to do so for a specific purpose or without specifying a purpose.\n\nApplication: In the given premise, the hypothesis states that a minor accepted an offer of gifts without getting consent from their legal representative. Since accepting the offer constitutes a juridical act, it should have been done with the consent of the legal representative as per Article 5(1). However, the article also states that this rule does not apply to a juridical act for merely acquiring a right or being released from an obligation. If the offer of gifts was without any burden, it could be considered as a right or a release from an obligation, and hence the consent of the legal representative may not be required. However, this exemption is not explicitly mentioned in the hypothesis, and it is unclear whether the offer was made without any burden.\n\nConclusion: Based on the analysis, it is not possible to determine whether the hypothesis is true or false without further information on the details of the gift offer.

The legal reasoning approach is as follows:\n\nIssue: Can the defendant assert that he/she exhausted his/her duty of care as deemed appropriate for the assigned supervision of person A as an affirmative defense?\n\nRule: Civil Code Article 715, Paragraph 1 states that an employer is liable for the tortious acts of his/her employees with respect to the execution of that business, but this does not apply if the employer exercised reasonable care in appointing the employee or in supervising the business, or if the damage could not have been avoided even if the employer had exercised reasonable care.\n\nApplication: In this case, the defendant may assert that he/she exercised reasonable care in supervising person A and that the damage could not have been avoided even if the defendant had exercised reasonable care.\n\nConclusion: Therefore, if the defendant can prove that he/she exercised reasonable care in supervising person A and that the damage could not have been avoided even if the defendant had exercised reasonable care, then the defendant can assert that he/she exhausted his/her duty of care as deemed appropriate for the assigned supervision of person A as an affirmative defense."}, {"@id": "H20-28-E", "@label": "Y", "t1": "Article 715\n(1) A person that employs another person for a business undertaking is liable to compensate for damage inflicted on a third party by that person's employees with respect to the execution of that business;provided, however, that this does not apply if the employer exercised reasonable care in appointing the employee or in supervising the business, or if the damage could not have been avoided even if the employer had exercised reasonable care.\n(2) A person that supervises a business on behalf of the employer also has the liability referred to in the preceding paragraph.\n(3) The provisions of the preceding two paragraphs do not preclude the employer or supervisor from exercising their right to reimbursement against the employee.", "t2": "If a plaintiff files against an agent supervisor of person A as a defendant on grounds that presuppose the establishment of liability by person A's tortious acts, and demands compensation of damages based on the liability of the agent supervisor in Civil Code Article 715, Paragraph 2, the defendant may assert that even by exercising his/her duty of reasonable care for the assigned supervision of person A, he/she could not have been avoided person A's creation of an injurious act as an affirmative defense.", "ChatGPT_output": "The hypothesis is false. According to Article 715, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, a person who supervises a business on behalf of the employer has liability for damages inflicted on a third party by the employees with respect to the execution of that business, unless the employer exercised reasonable care in appointing the employee or in supervising the business, or if the damage could not have been avoided even if the employer had exercised reasonable care. Therefore, if a plaintiff files against an agent supervisor of person A as a defendant on grounds that presuppose the establishment of liability by person A's tortious acts, and demands compensation of damages based on the liability of the agent supervisor in Civil Code Article 715, Paragraph 2, the defendant may assert that the employer exercised reasonable care in appointing the employee or in supervising the business, or that the damage could not have been avoided even if the employer had exercised reasonable care, as an affirmative defense."}, {"@id": "H20-28-O", "@label": "N", "t1": "Article 717\n(1) If a defect in the installation or preservation of a structure on land causes damage to another person, the possessor of that structure is liable to the person incurring damage to compensate for the damage;provided, however, that if the possessor has exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage, the owner must compensate for the damage.\n(2) The provisions of the preceding paragraph apply mutatis mutandis if there is a defect in the planting or supporting of bamboo or trees.\n(3) In the cases referred to in the preceding two paragraphs, if there is another person that is liable for the cause of the damage, the possessor or owner may exercise their right to reimbursement against that person.", "t2": "If a plaintiff files against a land owner as a defendant, and demands compensation of damages based on the liability of owner of structure on land proviso in Civil Code Article 717, Paragraph 1, the defendant may not assert that he/she exercised his/her required duty of care in order to prevent the occurrence of the results as an affirmative defense, but he/she may assert his/her own doli incapax as an affirmative defense.", "ChatGPT_output": "The hypothesis is false. The defendant can assert that they exercised their necessary duty of care to prevent the damage as an affirmative defense under Civil Code Article 717, Paragraph 1.
