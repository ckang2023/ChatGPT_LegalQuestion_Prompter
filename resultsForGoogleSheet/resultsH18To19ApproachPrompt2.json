Article 96(2) further specifies that if a third party commits fraud, inducing a first party to make a manifestation of intention to a second party, that manifestation of intention is voidable only if the second party knew or could have known that fact. Article 96(3) states that the rescission of a manifestation of intention induced by fraud under the provisions of the preceding two paragraphs may not be duly asserted against a third party in good faith acting without negligence.\n\nApplication: The hypothesis suggests that a person who made a manifestation of intention induced by duress emanating from a third party can rescind such manifestation of intention only if the other party knew or was negligent of such fact. However, the law does not mention duress emanating from a third party as an exception. Article 96(1) only requires the manifestation of intention to be based on fraud or duress to be voidable, without specifying the source of the fraud or duress.
