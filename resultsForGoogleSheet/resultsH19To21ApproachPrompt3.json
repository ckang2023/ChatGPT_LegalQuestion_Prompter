However, Article 5(3) permits a minor to dispose of property that their legal representative has allowed them to dispose of, even without obtaining their consent, provided that it falls within the scope of the permitted purpose.

The defendant may assert that he/she exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage and therefore, the owner must compensate for the damage.\n- Conclusion: The hypothesis is False. The defendant may assert the defense of exercising necessary care to prevent the damage under Civil Code Article 717, Paragraph 1. However, the defendant may not assert his/her own doli incapax as an affirmative defense, as it is not relevant to the issue of whether the defendant exercised necessary care to prevent the damage."}, {"@id": "H20-30-I", "@label": "N", "t1": "Article 93\n(1) The validity of a manifestation of intention is not impaired even if the person making it does so while knowing that it does not reflect that person's true intention;provided, however, that if the other party knew or could have known that the manifestation was not the true intention of the person who made it, that manifestation of intention is void.\n(2) The nullity of a manifestation of intention under the provisions of the proviso to the preceding paragraph may not be duly asserted against a third party in good faith.", "t2": "In the case of concealment of true intention, assuming the other party was unaware of the true intention of the party making the manifestation, and there was no gross negligence regarding that lack of knowledge, that manifestation of intention shall be valid.", "ChatGPT_output": "True. According to Article 93(1) of the Civil Code, the validity of a manifestation of intention is not impaired even if the person making it does so while knowing that it does not reflect that person's true intention.

Therefore, if the other party was not aware of the true intention and did not act with gross negligence regarding that lack of knowledge, the manifestation of intention would be considered valid.
