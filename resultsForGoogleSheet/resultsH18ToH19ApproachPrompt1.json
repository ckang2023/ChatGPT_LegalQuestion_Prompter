It is not explicitly stated whether the second party knew about the duress. According to the rules, if the duress had been induced by fraud, the manifestation of intention would be voidable only if the second party knew or could have known about the fraud. However, in the case of duress, there is no explicit mention of knowledge or negligence of the second party. Therefore, the application of the rules is inconclusive and depends on whether the duress can be equated to fraud.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the rules and the inconclusive application, it is difficult to reach a definitive conclusion about the hypothesis. However, if duress is considered similar to fraud in terms of its effect on the manifestation of intention, then the hypothesis would be true, and the other party's knowledge or negligence about the duress would be relevant to rescission. If duress is not considered similar to fraud, then the hypothesis would be false, and the other party's knowledge or negligence would not be relevant to rescission."}, {"@id": "H19-4-I", "@label": "Y", "t1": "Article 128\nWhile it is uncertain whether or not a condition will be fulfilled, a party to a juridical act that is subject to a condition may not prejudice the other party's interests that would arise from the juridical act upon fulfillment of the condition.", "t2": "In a sales contract subject to  a condition precedent, the buyer that intentionally damaged the object while it is uncertain whether or not the condition has been fulfilled shall bear liability for damages to the seller whose expectation right is infringed.", "ChatGPT_output": "Thesis: The hypothesis is evaluating whether a buyer in a sales contract subject to a condition precedent is liable for damages if they intentionally damage the object while the condition's fulfillment is uncertain.\n\nRules:\n- Article 128 provides that a party to a juridical act subject to a condition cannot prejudice the other party's interests that would arise from the act's fulfillment.\n- In a sales contract subject to a condition precedent, the seller retains ownership until the condition is fulfilled, and the buyer takes the risk of loss or damage to the goods until the condition is fulfilled (Article 173).\n\nApplication:\nIn the hypothesis, the sales contract is subject to a condition precedent, and it is uncertain whether the condition has been fulfilled.
