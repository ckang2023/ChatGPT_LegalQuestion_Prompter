According to Article 243, if two or more movable properties with different owners can no longer be separated without damage due to accession, the ownership of the composite thing belongs to the owner of the principal movable property. Therefore, in the scenario described in the hypothesis, ownership of the composite thing would belong to the owner of the principal movable property, which is A. However, Article 248 provides that a person who suffers loss because of the application of the provisions of Article 243 through the preceding Article may demand compensation in accordance with the provisions of Article 704, not Article 703.

According to Article 253(1), each co-owner should pay the expenses of management and bear burdens regarding the property in co-ownership in proportion to their interest. In the given premise, A has already paid for B's share of expenses, so there is no obligation for B to reimburse A. In addition, even if B fails to pay their share of expenses, it does not necessarily give A the right to acquire B's share.
